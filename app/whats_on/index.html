    <h3>Francis Charlton</h3>
    <p>
      Francis has been an Artist for over forty years, from spraying simple stencil outlines of vapourised people on walls of buildings in the West End of London, in the late 70s, to the fly-poster bombing of 'Warhol is Over' on the day Andy Warhol died, in February 87, on walls in London's Soho. Referencing John Lennon's iconic 'War is Over' poster campaign of 1971, which he revisited during the Gulf War(s) as 'Jihad is Over,' creating a postcard drop with 'Don't Panic' magazine.

        His 2010  'Walt's World,' in the land of the Mouse exhibition was, fortunately for the artist, a sell out, there are a number of extremly limited edition A3 prints available. Contact the artist.
