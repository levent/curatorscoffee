      <h2>Brewed Coffee Class</h2>

      <p>Working from home and weekends shouldn’t mean you have to miss out on
      your morning coffee. Filtered coffee is really simple to make and
      tastes great if you follow a few simple guidelines!</p>

      <p>We will be running <strong>Work From Home Coffee Classes</strong> to teach you the
      basics of making tasty filtered coffee.</p>

      <p>Classes go for <strong>1 hour</strong> and you will learn how to make filtered coffee
      using <strong>French Press</strong>, <strong>Aeropress</strong> and <strong>Pourover</strong> methods.</p>

      <p>Class costs <strong>£15 per person</strong> and there is a maximum of <strong>6 people per
        class</strong>.  For more info or details of upcoming classes contact Catherine
      on: <a href="mailto:contact@curatorscoffee.com">contact@curatorscoffee.com</a></p>
