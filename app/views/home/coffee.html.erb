      <p>February's Creation is called the <strong>East India Coffee</strong>. It is an
espresso based drink, made with our house espresso which is the Rogue
roasted by Union. We will be pulling the shots as ristrettos to obtain
an intense sweet flavour to which we will then add 6 ounces of creamy
steamed milk that has been infused for 48 hrs with warm spices of
cardamon, cinnamon and star anise, along with vanilla, honey and
ginger.</p>

<p>Smooth, warm delicious and comforting. Perfect for February weather.</p>

      <p>The concept of Curators Coffee developed from our attempts to visualise the art of coffee and our desire to create a gallery space for our craft. A collaboration between talented furniture builder Jason, of madebyjason and designer extraordinaire Jen Archer led to Curators Coffee Studio, a space of free thought, where things are collected and recreated or reimagined. To reflect this we've used a mix of recycled, new and artisan materials to bring this to life.</p>
